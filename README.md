# Breakfast Project
Final project made during the Coders Lab bootcamp "JavaScript Developer: React".

Live version: https://www.breakfast-app.com

Simple web app which helps to find new breakfast ideas by choosing countries from the world map. 
The project was made in ReactJS library and styled with the use of styled-components (https://www.styled-components.com/).
The clickable map was created with the help of react-simple-maps components library (https://www.react-simple-maps.io/). 

The main goal of the project was to present my ReactJS front-end skills. For that reason, the content (breakfast database) and back-end features are not yet fully developed. I hope, though, to finish them in the future.
